# circular-lspr-slide-rule
An open source tribute to the Orest Bedrij, the book '1' and his life's work, specifically his research into the relationships of the fundamental constants 
and the principles of Each One Teach One (EOTO).

The inspiration for this project was formed at an EOTO retreat in 2017 whereby after the project founder giving a science talk made a promise to continue the work and spread the scientific message.


The circular logarithmic slide rule for fundamental physical constants allows plotting fundamental physical constants using arctangent and logarithmic projections onto circular wheels forming a slide rule.

In the arctangent mode, the slide rule allows investigations of the alignment of constants against geometric shapes within a unit circle.
In logarithmic mode, the slide rule allows investigations of the alignment of constants with natural scaling.


The software prototype is minimal in preparaion for development. Initially control is via keypresses with key usage shown as text printed in the startup log (not yet as a text window.

Enjoy, learn and teach others of the knowledge that you gain in the spirit of EOTO.
